## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/Buy-From-Egypt-AI-models.git
cd Buy-From-Egypt-AI-models

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the API and Tester App

```bash
# Run everything with one command (API server + Streamlit app)
./start_all.sh

# Or run them separately:
# Terminal 1: Start the API server
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run test_recommendations.py
```

### 3. Using the API Directly

```bash
# Get post recommendations for a user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/recommendations/posts?user_id=user_1&num_recommendations=5" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preferred_industries": ["Technology", "Manufacturing"]}'

# Get product recommendations
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/recommendations/products?user_id=user_1&num_recommendations=5" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"preferred_industries": ["Technology"]}'

# Record a user interaction
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/interactions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user_1",
    "item_id": "123",
    "item_type": "post",
    "interaction_type": "view",
    "dwell_time_seconds": 45
  }'
```
